# Tools

There isn't a single set of "must-have" tools that every designer at WAC needs, but there are sets of tools that make designing easy. In addition, many of the templates that WAC builds its design off of were made in specific softwares: in those scenarios, designers will have to use that software.

#### A Note on Software Versioning

In the wide majority of cases, WAC will simply use the latest stable version of respective software. However, with some software \(most notably Adobe software\), this is not feasible from a budgetary or technological perspective. Therefore, we always recommend saving copies of files in backwards-compatible file formats, and coordinating with other members of the design team on software versions. This is especially a problem when handing off files from major Adobe versions, such as Photoshop CC to Photoshop CS5.

## General Purpose Tools

These tools are essential for most designers, mostly because they can perform basic image operations that any designer \(graphic, video, web, otherwise\) will have to use. Getting familiar with these tools makes the WAC design workflow simple.

### Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop is the definition of a designer's "Swiss Army Knife". It's useful in manipulating images, creating quick mockups, and applying special effects to designs. We suggest that any designer gets familiar with Photoshop \(or a free alternative, such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)\), as it will pay dividends in the future.

Photoshop is often used to create "one-of" designs that are minimal in nature, such as Recruitment Posters. For more complicated designs \(such as Logos or Packages\), we recommend that you use Illustrator or InDesign \(whichever is more appropriate\).

Students can talk to their WAC supervisor to get a license for the Adobe Suite, which includes Photoshop.

### Adobe Illustrator

Illustrator is a good companion to Photoshop, filling in the gaps where Photoshop is lacking. It's useful in creating vectors and other illustrations, and unlike Photoshop it can export to SVG. Knowing the basics of using Illustrator can go a long way in expanding a designer's skills.

Illustrator is often used in creating components or more complex designs: we used illustrator in creating logos \(Program and Conference\), the Program Posters, and minor components of other designs. In addition, many designs can be created in Illustrator and then exported to Photoshop or InDesign. Also, it's used to manipulate SVGs \(something that Photoshop cannot do\).

### Colour Picker \([Sip](https://sipapp.io/), [ColorSnapper 2](https://colorsnapper.com), etc.\)

There are many colour pickers available to download, and WAC doesn't prefer a certain one \(\*cough\* [Sip](https://sipapp.io/)\), but having a colour picker is particularly useful in design - it can ensure that designs follow the WAC style guide, and also grab colour values from other sources. Some colour pickers also allow users to save colour palettes, which is particularly useful for WAC design.

## Specialist Tools

### Adobe InDesign

InDesign is the software that we use to make complex ready-to-print materials, specifically the Delegate Package and the Nametags. InDesign is great at creating layouts for multi-page designs, using data to generate data-based materials \(i.e. nametags\), and generally making documents that are ready to print. Using InDesign is a breeze if one is already familiar with Photoshop and/or Illustrator.

### Adobe Premiere

Premiere is the professional video editing software that we use at WAC. We use Premiere not only due to its huge feature-set and its compatibility with other Adobe Software \(e.g. After Effects, Audition\), but also because all of the computers in UCC's Film Dept. come preloaded with Premiere and are powerful enough to render videos quickly enough.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free and open-source audio editor, which can be a good alternative to Adobe Audition when it's unavailable. Learning to use Audacity is quick and easy, and it's useful in a lot of different applications: for the video, online content, and for the livestream.

### Code Editor \([Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\)

Coding is a really useful tool skill to have in a wide variety of jobs, and design is no exception. All of web design/development hinges on using code, and coding also comes in handy when manipulating swathes of data or doing checks on human work. While WAC doesn't have a preferred editor \(for real this time\), there is a plethora of editors available online. Since most of our work is with web development and light data work, your editor needs to support Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

GitHub Desktop is an open-source visual Git client made by GitHub. Since we use [GitHub extensively at WAC](https://github.com/worldaffairsconference), having a Git client can help simplify the coding workflow and make adopting version control easier.

### [Nik Collection](https://nikcollection.dxo.com/)

The Nik Collection is a super useful \(albeit niche\) free piece of software that can make photos more vibrant. We've used the Nik Collection to apply filters on photos used on printed materials.

### [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS is the free and open-source software that we use to create the livestream. To find out more about OBS, check out [the livestream page](../The Design Lifecycle/livestream.md).

### [Svgsus](http://www.svgs.us/)

Svgsus is a useful tool that helps designers organize and manipulate their SVG libraries \(e.g. Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, Octicons\).
