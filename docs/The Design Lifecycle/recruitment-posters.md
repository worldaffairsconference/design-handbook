# Recruitment Posters

Recruitment posters are a relatively minor part of the WAC Design Lifecycle. Essentially, they're materials put around UCC and BH to find people to work in certain departments. There is no "correct" type of recruitment poster - it's all up to the designer! It just needs to be compelling and have the correct contact information.

Posters can be any size and can be made in any program that the designer is comfortable with, though in the past WAC Recruitment Posters have been made in Photoshop and Illustrator and are typically 13" by 19" - a size that is the most "bang for the buck" for printing at the print shop. However, we recommend experimenting if it makes a better poster!
