# Social Media

Social Media is becoming an ever more prevalent part of the world we live in today, and that's no exception for WAC. We manage a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/worldaffairsconference/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/worldaffairscon), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/WorldAffairsCon) page, and a lot of our online presence hinges on design to deliver our message to our audience. 

Admittedly, WAC's social media presence has been subprime over the years - much of this comes from a lack of coordination between the programs team, the social media team, and the design team. This document aims to unify the information that all three of those teams will need to know, with a special emphasis on design.

The actual design skills required for social media posts is relatively low - the designer just needs intermediate proficiency in Photoshop to stitch together different resources. However, unlike other designs at WAC, social media designs need to efficiently and powerfully deliver their message, due to the nature of the medium \(high bounce rates, low attention spans\).

## Types and Timelines

Generally, all the social media interactions that WAC makes can be categorized into two categories, based on their purpose: "pushes" that alert our audience to WAC's events \(registration opening, registration closing, open keynote\), and "engagements", where WAC showcases its events and interacts directly with our audience.
