# The Roadmap

## Lifecycles

Each "lifecycle" starts in April, when the Conference Chair and the rest of the staff are decided, and ends in February, when the conference ends. While the exact dates in each lifecycle will vary based on the current staff list and circumstances, following the recommended timelines makes everything run smoothly.
