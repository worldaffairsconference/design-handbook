# The Basics

## What is WAC?

The World Affairs Conference is a current affairs conference jointly hosted by Upper Canada College and Branksome Hall. It's the oldest student-led current affairs conference in Canada, and it aims to provide a high quality experience for all attending delegates.

## What is Design at WAC?

Design at WAC is fundamental to ensuring a high-quality conference experience: it allows us to convey our message in the best way possible, and encourage more people to participate in one of the best events that Toronto has to offer. Everything at WAC is organized and created by students, including all design-related materials - that means that an immense amount of coordination and skill is needed to create an awesome design experience.

"Design" is a very broad term: within WAC's Design team, we have Graphic Designers, Video Makers, Web Designers, Social Media Managers, an Audio/Visual team, and more! For everything to function properly, each member of the design team needs to know what their role is in this giant puzzle piece, and how they interact with other members of WAC's team.
