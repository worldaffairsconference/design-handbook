# Printing

Many materials at WAC need to be printed. Typically, we print through UCC's Print Shop - contactable at [uccpress@ucc.on.ca](mailto:uccpress@ucc.on.ca).

### Useful Tips

Whenever a design is made to print, there are always a few things to consider:

* What is the size of the design? Does it fit the size of the final printed product? Does the design need to be scaled?
* Does the design print cleanly? Are there enough margins on the sides?
* Are the colours distinct? Do they fit the style guide? Under different lighting conditions, will the design still make sense?
* Does the design **need** to be in colour? Grayscale designs can be equally as effective and be astronomically cheaper.
* Is the current print order price-efficient? Should many more be ordered than needed, and then re-used for multiple years?
* Is the design dated? Does it rely on certain elements that change year-to-year, making it non-reusable?
