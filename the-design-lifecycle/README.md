# The Design Lifecycle

This section of the Design Handbook aims to document the WAC Design Lifecycle, which is all the materials that design needs to produce every year. While there will be minute changes year to year, this general format is likely to be followed.

Each page in this section \(except the [Roadmap,](the-roadmap.md) which acts as a table of contents\) will contain a brief overview of what each product will cover, the tools required to make the product, the recommended team size of the product, visual examples of the product \(if applicable\), and general tips and recommendations to design and production.
