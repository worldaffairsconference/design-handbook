# Nametags

## Overview

We print three different kinds of nametags: delegate nametags, which are double-sided and have each delegate's information on them, faculty nametags, which are single-sided and have just the school name, and staff nametags, which are also single-sided and have the staff position. 

All of the nametags are templated in InDesign, generated with Data Merge, and then exported to PDF and printed. Nametag design is relatively simple \(as they don't change year by year and most of the heavy lifting comes from computing\), but it's important to look out for edge cases, such as spelling errors, non-Unicode characters, and cutoff text.

## Data Merge

Data Merge is a powerful tool in Adobe InDesign that allows you to create a template file and export many copies of that file, with data populated from an input source. We use Data Merge to generate our nametags from information in an excel spreadsheet.
