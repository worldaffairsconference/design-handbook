# Tools of the Trade

There isn't a single set of "must-have" tools that every designer at WAC needs, but there are sets of tools that make designing easy. In addition, many of the templates that WAC builds its design off of were made in specific softwares: in those scenarios, designers will have to use that software.

## General Purpose Tools

These tools are essential for most designers, mostly because they can perform basic image operations that any designer \(graphic, video, web, otherwise\) will have to use. Getting familiar with these tools makes the WAC design workflow simple.

#### Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop is the definition of a designer's "Swiss Army Knife". It's useful in manipulating images, creating quick mockups, and applying special effects to designs. We suggest that any designer gets familiar with Photoshop \(or a free alternative, such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)\), as it will pay dividends in the future.

Photoshop is often used to create "one-of" designs that are minimal in nature, such as Recruitment Posters. For more complicated designs \(such as Logos or Packages\), we recommend that you use Illustrator or InDesign \(whichever is more appropriate\).

Students can talk to their WAC supervisor to get a license for the Adobe Suite, which includes Photoshop.

#### Adobe Illustrator

Illustrator is a good companion to Photoshop, filling in the gaps where Photoshop is lacking. It's useful in creating vectors and other illustrations, and unlike Photoshop it can export to SVG. Knowing the basics of using Illustrator can go a long way in expanding a designer's skills.

Illustrator is often used in creating components or more complex designs: we used illustrator in creating logos \(Program and Conference\), the Program Posters, and minor components of other designs. In addition, many designs can be created in Illustrator and then exported to Photoshop or InDesign. Also, it's used to manipulate SVGs \(something that Photoshop cannot do\). 

#### Colour Picker \([Sip](https://sipapp.io/), [ColorSnapper 2](https://colorsnapper.com), etc.\)

There are many colour pickers available to download, and WAC doesn't prefer a certain one \(\*cough\* [Sip](https://sipapp.io/)\), but having a colour picker is particularly useful in design - it can ensure that designs follow the WAC style guide, and also grab colour values from other sources. Some colour pickers also allow users to save colour palettes, which is particularly useful for WAC design.
